# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 Javascript

This module was to create a webpage with data about Belly Button Biodiversity that was given for this Module.

I used Expert Learning to source code for the bubble trace and bar chart as well as referencing past work done during class.

Clicking on the index.html file will send you to the appropriate page to demonstrate a table chart and bubble chart starting with Subject ID no: 940.

You can use the drop down to switch Subjects.
